<h2 style=color:var(--body);>About Us</h2>
<p>
    Team 60 was created at the beggining of the semester by our instructors, and it will continue to exist until the end of this semester. Team consist of 4 people that are from one CRN : Jeyhun , Laman, Nihad and Faig . As a team we have a quite impressive work so far and we will continue to do so in the future. We had 
3 assignments during this time period ;more specifically : Constructed <strong>Logic Gates</strong> , conduct <strong>Hour of Code</strong> and currently creating <strong>website</strong>. During all this assignments we did our best and even break through our limits, even if we couldn't do something at first we tried over and over until we would be able to achive success , no matter what we pushed.For instance, during our first assignment in which we had to create <strong>Logic Gates</strong> , we as a team failed and failed miserably our first attempt of constructing gates , after ah hour of attempt in the lab we were crushed mentally ; nevertheless we didn't give up , because <strong>who cares</strong>if we had one failed attempt or not , the only thing that matters is the result , so we analyzed our mistakes 
and resolved our mistakes , at the end of our assignment we achieved success. </p>
